'Tis the dawn before Humdinger Day when the crystals begin to hum, and hum and hum they do. It is a forewarning, a message, a symbol of prophecy that only comes once every few generations to give the divine people of Blibblerysnicket a chance to thwart a terrible fate. A threat looms on the horizon, an oh-so-appalling peril that could drive the world into a cataclysm. For if the sacred Humdinger Day celebrations are ever disrupted, the Humdingers would arise from the earth and consume the sun, pitting the world into an eternal darkness, one where no soul could enjoy a single s'more.

In this hour of need, in the time of crisis, the oracular crystals designate you, a budding wizard with a passing talent at swinging a stick, as their champion. You watch as the elders of the village press their heads to the ground in your presence out of devotion. You realize it then: you are the chosen one, literally, metaphorically, and in every which way and form. With a penchant for magic and your trusty old stick, you set off to defend your beloved home of Blibblerysnicket from the intruders - a gray army encompassing over fifty shades - and stop them from interrupting the essential Humdinger Day ceremonies.

A truly daunting task indeed, but you know what is at stake. Even if you have to pass out on the lovely blood-red drinks of Humdinger Day, the burnt radishes, and the deliciously viscous cheeses, you forge on. It is only through sheer force of iron will that you can forget those precious vices for a day, long enough to fight back the enemy that threatens the world as you know it. You are a partially fully-grown pubescent juvenile on a mission, but no one can stop you from destroying the villains who are forcing you to get up and go on a walk.
